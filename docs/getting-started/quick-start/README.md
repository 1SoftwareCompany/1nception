# Quick Start

### Business requirements

* We need a new task management system.
* We need data to be consistent.&#x20;
* We need to be able to reassign tasks inside the user group.&#x20;
* We need an accurate progress report for every user.&#x20;
* Groups progress report needs to be secured such that only group members can access it.&#x20;
* We need a notification to the group members when a user finishes his task.&#x20;
* We need a screen to view the historical changes in user activity.&#x20;
* When users close their accounts we need to ask them why (optional survey).
* We need to generate a monthly report that indicates why lost users closed their accounts.
