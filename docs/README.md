# Introduction

## Welcome to Cronus documentation

Cronus is an open source framework which helps you solve business problems with less time spent on infrastructure concerns. Applications built with Cronus are centered around three core concepts:

* Domain Driven Design
* Event Sourcing
* Command Query Responsibility Segregation

While many types of applications can be built using Cronus, it has proven to be very popular for microservices architectures. Cronus provides an innovative and powerful way of sensibly evolving to event-driven microservices within a microservice architecture.
