# Introduction

Welcome to the Cronus Manual!

Cronus provides the Cronus Framework to help build applications centred on three core concepts - CQRS \(Command Query Responsibility Segregation\) / Event Sourcing and DDD \(Domain Driven Design\).

While many types of applications can be built using Cronus, it has proven to be very popular for microservices architectures. Cronus provides an innovative and powerful way of sensibly evolving to event-driven microservices within a microservice architecture.
